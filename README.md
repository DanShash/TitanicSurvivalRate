## Titanic Survival Rate Prediction Project

### Overview

This project focuses on predicting the survival rate of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about passengers such as their age, gender, class, and whether they survived the disaster.

### Data Loading and Understanding

The project starts by loading the Titanic dataset, which is divided into training and test sets. The dataset includes various attributes such as passenger ID, survival status, class, name, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket number, fare, cabin number, and embarked port.

### Data Preprocessing

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and convert categorical attributes into numerical values. Numerical attributes are standardized, and categorical attributes are encoded appropriately.

### Model Selection and Training

Two different classifiers are trained and evaluated: a Random Forest Classifier and a Support Vector Classifier (SVC). Cross-validation is used to assess the performance of each model and choose the best one.

### Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated based on their accuracy scores obtained through cross-validation. The Random Forest Classifier and SVC achieve accuracy scores of approximately 82% and 83%, respectively.

### Conclusion and Future Work

The project concludes by suggesting ways to further improve the model, such as trying different algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and performing more feature engineering. Despite achieving a reasonably high accuracy score, there is room for improvement to enhance the model's performance.
